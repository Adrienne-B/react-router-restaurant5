Navbar is a component is "global" so whatever element/effect you want to have for all the pages you put it in
the components folder. For example...we want Navbar to be shown on all pages, so navbar is inside the compoenent
folder, when we link ANY components, it should be b/w <Router> and <Routes> in the App.js.

Remember the App.js is the main page/"index.html"
For example 1:
    <Router>
        <Navbar />                            
     <Routes>

                                OR

For example 2:
    <Router>
        <Navbar></Navbar>            
     <Routes>
